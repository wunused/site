I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student at Columbia University advised by
Professor [Junfeng Yang](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~junfeng/). I am broadly
interested in computer system security. My research applies program analysis
techniques to solve software security problems.

Some of my previous work includes: inferring policies to securely load
pre-trained machine learning models from untrusted sources; mitigating the
exploitation of deserialization vulnerabilities; and identifying optimizations
that make compiled programs easier to exploit.

I am supported by the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG)
Fellowship.
