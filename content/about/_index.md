I am a Ph.D. student in the Columbia University Department of Computer Science,
advised by Professor [Junfeng Yang](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~junfeng/). I am
broadly interested in computer system security. My research applies program
analysis techniques to solve software security problems.

I am supported by the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG)
Fellowship.

I participate in CTF competitions and volunteer my time mentoring CU Cyber,
Columbia's club for security-interested students.
