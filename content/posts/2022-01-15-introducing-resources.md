I was once told that if I ever independently gave the same advice to two
different people, I should write the advice down and post it publicly for
anyone else to access. I don't have a lot of original advice to give yet (hence
the scarcity of content on this site), but I do regularly refer back to the
advice contained in materials created by experienced professionals, and I
frequently point others to those materials, too.

In order to reference those materials more easily, I've decided to post them on
the [resources](/resources) page of this site. I intend for the page to be a
living collection as I discover materials, but I do not intend for it to ever
be an exhaustive list of learning sources. Please feel free to reach out to
discuss any of the materials in more depth.
